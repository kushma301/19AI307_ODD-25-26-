# Ex.No:5(E) MULTITHREADING -SYNCHRONIZATION

## QUESTION:

Maintain two int variables a and b, read their initial values from user. Use synchronized block to swap them and print swapped values.

## AIM:

To write a Java program that reads two integers from the user and swaps their values using a synchronized block to ensure thread-safe operations.


## ALGORITHM :

Read two integer values a and b from the user.

Create a lock object to use inside the synchronized block.

Enter the synchronized block using the lock object.

Swap the values of a and b using a temporary variable.

Exit the synchronized block once the swap is complete.

Print the swapped values of a and b.

Close the scanner.



## PROGRAM:
 ```

```

## SOURCE CODE:


    import java.util.Scanner;
    
    public class SwapUsingSynchronized {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            int a = sc.nextInt();
            int b = sc.nextInt();
            Object lock = new Object();
    
            synchronized (lock) {
                int temp = a;
                a = b;
                b = temp;
            }
    
            System.out.println("a = " + a);
            System.out.println("b = " + b);
            sc.close();
        }
    }

## RESULT:
Therefore the program successfully swaps two integers within a synchronized block, ensuring safe and controlled access.
